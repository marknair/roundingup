# Rounding Up

Write a C program that asks the user to enter a decimal between -1 and 1 (including 1 and -1) by saying “Enter a decimal between -1 and 1: ” (If the number is not in this range, it should ask them again.)

Then it should round the number to the nearest integer: -1, 0, or 1:
- If the rounded number is 1 or -1, print: “Ah, you seem to live on the edge.”
- Otherwise, print: “The middle path seems to be for you.”
